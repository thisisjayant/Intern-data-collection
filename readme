# Resume Processing Automation

## Overview
This project automates the extraction and processing of resume data from multiple PDF files. It uses `pdfplumber` to extract text, `pandas` to structure the extracted data, and regular expressions (`re`) for pattern recognition. The processed data is then stored in an Excel file, with clickable links for each resume.

## Features
- **Bulk Processing:** Handles multiple resumes stored in a specified folder.
- **Text Extraction:** Extracts text content from PDF resumes using `pdfplumber`.
- **Data Parsing:** Extracts key details like name, phone number, email, LinkedIn profile, introduction, work experience, and education.
- **Experience Calculation:** Determines total years of experience based on date ranges in work experience.
- **Top Institute Check:** Identifies if the candidate graduated from IIT, IIIT, BITS, or NIT.
- **Hyperlinked Excel Report:** Saves extracted data in an Excel sheet with clickable resume links for quick access.

## Requirements
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the script:

```sh
pip install pdfplumber pandas openpyxl xlsxwriter
```

## File Structure
```
resume_project/
│── script.py (Main script)
│── Resumes/ (Folder containing all resume PDFs)
│── resume_with_links.xlsx (Output Excel file)
```

## Usage
1. Place all resume PDFs in the `Resumes/` folder.
2. Update `output_path` and `resume_folder` variables in the script as needed.
3. Run the script:

```sh
python script.py
```

4. The processed data will be saved to `resume_with_links.xlsx` with clickable links to resumes.

## Output Fields
| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| File Name | Name of the PDF file |
| Name | Extracted candidate name |
| Phone | Extracted phone number |
| Email | Extracted email address |
| LinkedIn | Extracted LinkedIn profile URL |
| Intro | Extracted introduction/summary |
| Work Experience | Extracted work experience details |
| Total Experience (Years) | Calculated total experience in years |
| Education | Extracted education details |
| Top Institute Graduate | Whether the candidate is from IIT/IIIT/BITS/NIT |
| Resume Link | Clickable link to open the resume |

## Notes
- The script assumes resumes are formatted with sections titled "Experience," "Education," etc.
- Accuracy depends on the formatting and readability of the PDF files.
- Adjust the `re.search()` patterns if resumes follow different structures.
